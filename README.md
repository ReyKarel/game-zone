# game-zone

A program with 3 CLI games and a navigation menu

Start the program from Main_menu.py!

The program creates a CSV file locally that contains player info and scores so that progress is saved. 
You can quit start again from where you left and your scores and login names will be saved.
Made as a final project of a python programming course.
